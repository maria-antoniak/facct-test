# Connect with FAccT
We have several channels to facilitate deeper connection with the Fairness, Accountability, and Transparency community.

## Social Media
You can follow FAccT on LinkedIn, Mastodon, or Twitter for annnouncements.

## Slack
We have an open Slack workspace for FAccT community discussions. This is open to anyone to sign up, but participation is governed by the Policy Against Discrimination and Harassment.

## FACCT-ANNOUNCE
FACCT-ANNOUNCE is a low-traffic mailing list for high-priority communications. It only carries official FAccT announcements, such as the conference calls for contributions, important FAccT community information, and the monthly FAccT Network Update. Messages to this list come from the FAccT executive committee, publicity chairs, or network chairs.

## FACCT-DISCUSS
FACCT-DISCUSS is an open mailing list for the FAccT community to post announcements relevant to the Fairness, Accountability, and Transparency community (such as calls for papers or participation, open position announcements, and similar information of community interest), as well as discussion of FAccT-related topics. This list is lightly moderated, but participation is governed by the Policy Against Discrimination and Harassment; repeated off-topic posting may also result in suspension of posting privileges.
