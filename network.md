# ACM FAccT Network
The ACM FAccT Network is a network of workshops, special issues, and other opportunities to publish and engage with fairness, accountability, and transparency scholars across connected disciplines.

If you have more questions, contact the ACM FAccT Network Co-chairs Michael Ekstrand and Meg Young at network@facctconference.org.

## Joining the Network
Do you have an upcoming workshop, special issue, or similar event centered around FAccT topics? We invite you to apply to have it considered a part of the network.

## Requirements and Process
Fill out the application form, and the Network Co-Chairs will consider your application and get in touch with you. To be part of the ACM FAccT Network, your event must:

## Engage with FAccT topics in a central way. For examples, see previous events below.
Have an open call for participation — i.e., not only for invited participants.
Adopt a Code of Conduct. (Workshops attached to ACM-sponsored events are automatically subject to the ACM Policy Against Harassment.)
Disseminate a summary/report after the event (which can range in format from a brief Medium post to a more detailed publication).

## Benefits
When you become part of the ACM FAccT Network:

We’ll help spread the word about your event to the FAccT community via the network web site, FAccT social media, and in a monthly digest sent to the FAT-ANNOUNCE listserv.
We’ll help give visibility to your event outcomes (workshop reports or other documents).
Association with ACM FAccT helps communicate the scope/intent of the event to participants.

## Upcoming Opportunities
These opportunities are upcoming and are currently accepting submissions:

Now until 9/31: The Adversarial Nibbler Challenge is a competition to discover failure modes in generative text-to-image models; submit seemingly safe prompts that generate an unsafe image. Top leaderboard participants will be invited to collaborate on work describing their attack techniques and strategies and to present their approach in relevant venues or workshops.
Ongoing reading group at The Institute of Humanity-centric AI (ELLIS Alicante), a virtual reading group for FAccT topics.

## Upcoming Events and Publications
These events are upcoming; look out for their outcomes soon! Some events may still be open for participation.
